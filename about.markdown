I work as a Technical Product Manager at [Lang.ai](https://lang.ai), a platform to automate the tagging of support tickets and calls. You can learn more about my work experience in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fjaguero/).

## Side projects

In 2017, I launched my first book about productivity, [The Success Hacker](https://thesuccesshacker.es/). In 2019, I started [In Progress Show](http://inprogressshow.com), a podcast where we look at how tech companies work from the inside.

## Community

_Developers_

I started [ValenciaJS](https://medium.com/the-web-is-the-platform/introducing-valenciajs-1a73d39a9c94) in 2015 as an effort to empower the JS community in Valencia, the third biggest city of Spain. In 2017, I started [MadridDevs](https://medium.com/@fjaguero/introducing-madrid-devs-2712c6c38e3c), A public Slack team to empower the local developer’s community.

_The Web_

I’ve been involved in the [Mozilla Hispano](https://www.mozilla-hispano.org/documentacion/Usuario:Fjaguero) community for almost 5 years now, helping to promote openness, innovation & opportunity on the Web. I gave talks in Argentina, Spain, Peru and Poland related to Mozilla. I'm proud [to be part](https://www.mozilla.org/credits/) of the hundreds of contributors that have made a significant investment of time to make the world a little bit better.

_Languages_

Since September 2017 I've been organizing the [Duolingo Spanish and English meetups](http://events.duolingo.com/madrid/) in Madrid. Now I'm a Gold Global Ambassador, helping to get Madrid to be the first city to have Duolingo language meetups in the top six languages.
