    <p>While writing my 2015 recap post I stumbled with a <a href="http://www.bonillaware.com/objetivos-para-2016">post</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/david_bonilla">David Bonilla</a> through twitter, it was another <em>resolutions</em> post. After reading the article I moved to the comments and discovered that <a href="https://twitter.com/elenarcolepsia">Elena Torró</a> was using an idea she found on GitHub: <strong>a repo to create your goals as issues</strong>, getting the closed issues as achievements.</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/362L150u0O20/life-comment.png" alt="Comment on the blog" /></p>

<p>This experiment was started by <a href="https://github.com/feross/Life">Feross Aboukhadijeh</a> back in 2013 and it’s basically another way to map your short/medium/long term goals. The main difference is that this is public by default (you still can have your repo private), and it’s a nice way to get all your achievements tracked in a place you usually visit.</p>

<p>These are my <em>issues</em> right now:
<img src="http://cl.ly/2x3D3S0f0z3x/Image%202016-01-06%20at%201.59.54%20a.%20m..png" alt="Issues" /></p>

<p>I also wanted to create a to-do list when possible as it makes easier to track and complete the goals by making small and constant progress. This is my <em>work-in-progress</em> reading list:</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/312k3w3h3D1P/Image%202016-01-06%20at%202.00.58%20a.%20m..png" alt="Reading list" /></p>

<h3 id="how-am-i-going-to-achieve-all-of-this">How am I going to achieve all of this?</h3>

<p>I am fan of tracking things (no, I don’t have a fitness tracker band) and to make stuff happen, so what I’m doing right now is <strong>writing a daily note every morning</strong> with the top 3 priorities, the daily timeline, what I am grateful for, etc. There’s also a night routine where I write the wins, lessons learned and the night gratitude. The key here is that this note has a <em>goals</em> section where I have every single goal reminding me to take action.</p>

<p>The yesterday’s note looked like this:
<img src="http://cl.ly/2L1p3Y303I3R/Image%202016-01-06%20at%202.28.47%20a.%20m..png" alt="Note" /></p>

<p>These goals change over time and it’s a selection of what has a higher priority or are kind of <em>quick-wins</em>.</p>

<p>The workflow is heavily borrowed from the <a href="http://bestself.co/products/self-journal">SELF Journal</a>, something I just bought this week as it’s a project I’d like to support.</p>

<p>I share what they think of getting stuff done:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The secret to success is in the small actions you take every day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By taking little steps and staying focused you can achieve whatever you want, you just need to <strong>create some habits</strong>.</p>

<p>Never settle.</p>
