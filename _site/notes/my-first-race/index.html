<p><strong>Today has been a day to remember</strong>.</p>

<p>The first challenge has been completed after weeks of effort. I ran my first race with more than 14.000 people, it was the <em>Volta a Peu</em>. Everything started as a sunday plan with my office co-workers. 3 of us were going to run that day. It was going to be my first real race.</p>

<p><img src="http://cl.ly/image/0S1Y0y272u0b/voltaapeu32.jpg" alt="Volta a Peu XXXII" /></p>

<p>I was worried about my calves but at the end there was no problem. In fact, I felt pretty good while crossing the finish line. No muscle pain. It was true what people said about running with thousands of people around you… you will run more than you imagine.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h2>

<p>It was almost impossible to start running. Too much people, not much space. After 2 minutes I started running with my workmate Bernardo, and until the finished we maintaned almost the same rhythm. It was not about doing the best time or breaking a personal record, it was just a starting point. It was funny to listen to people saying to his partner: “C’mon, we are almost there! You can do it!”. It was a completely new experience.</p>

<p>Every kilometer all the people started applauding to motivate the rest of us. A moment to remember was the crossing of a tunnel, full of people shouting and applauding. Before entering the tunnel there was a tourist bus who stopped to watch the people run (good timing!).</p>

<h2 id="crossing-the-line">Crossing the line</h2>

<p>There’s no need to say that <strong>the best moment was to cross the finish line</strong>. A big clock, hundreds of people applauding, loud music. We crossed the line around the minute 50, but that was not important, at least for me. It was such a good experience that I wasn’t exhausted at all. The weeks before I tried to run 8k by myself and I finished really tired. I walked one minuted every kilometer to finish that 8k race. This time I ran 8.4k and they felt like 4.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>We already have plans for the next challenge. It will be on October, a half marathon… which is 21 kilometers, almost 3 times this race! It may sound like a big deal, but I still have 4 months to be prepared. With effort and continuity I’m sure I can make this happen… as anything in life.</p>
