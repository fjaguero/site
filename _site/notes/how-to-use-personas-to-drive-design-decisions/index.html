    <p>Taking design decisions is not an easy task, specially if you and your team don’t have a clear vision about the early adopters and target users. Here is where Personas come to help. <strong>We will be discussing what they are, how to build them and why they are important</strong>.</p>

<p>A Persona is an archetype of a typical user of your product: a fictional character with name and a full story around him.</p>

<p>You target users can be probably <em>translated</em> in at least 2 or 3 clear <em>Personas</em>.</p>

<h2 id="why-they-are-important">Why they are important</h2>

<p>TODO</p>

<h2 id="building-personas">Building Personas</h2>
<p>In order to build a Persona, you need to have a clear vision of what you are going to build. This includes a series of assumptions: [business goal, problem to solve, target, among others].</p>

<p>There is no step-by-step perfect guide to build a Persona since it may vary depending of what info you have and the level of detail you want for them.</p>

<h3 id="gather-the-required-information">Gather the required information</h3>

<p>If you don’t have resources and you can’t afford gather information by interviewing people for a certain period of time, you should follow the Lean UX strategy. This way, you will be developing Personas using assumptions. As you may now, the Lean UX methodology strives for a quick and iterative approach to develop a product. This may be a little dangerous, specially if your team have the same background. For example, no one worked in the food industry and you are building a product related with food. The assumptions may not differ enough to consider another quick reality check.</p>

<p>In the other hand, if you already spent time interviewing potential users or early adopters, you will be using this information to develop each one.</p>

<h3 id="use-a-template">Use a template</h3>

<p>As I already said, there’s no perfect way to develop personas, so I designed this template by taking what I liked from what I learned before and added what I thought it was missing or will be adding value.</p>

<p>Let’s have a look at this <a href="http://https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Uca_Q67QPoui4-FhE0j_jNBby0rfpZWj_MG6Uy36pw/edit">example Persona</a> for a clothing store. Feel free to leave suggestions and use it for your project.</p>

<p><img src="http://" alt="Personas Templae" /></p>

<p>The avatar is taken from a public repository of photos, <a href="http://http://uifaces.com/authorized">UI faces</a>. All this users have given their consent, so feel free to use them.</p>

<p>I like to dive a little bit in the personal story… at the end of the day your team should think of her as a user that exists and, probably, is willing to become a power user if all the design decisions taken makes him happier.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">[Conclusion]?</h2>

<p>Developing Personas is a key point in the UX process. If you are building a product or even if you have already done it, consider taking the time to discuss this deliverable with your team. This will clarify all the doubts and will <em>force</em> the team to share a common vision and to understand why the product they are building is useful. You can actually imagen the Personas you already developed enjoying your product.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask any question or add a comment to improve the template.</p>

<p>In next posts I will be talking a bit more in the early process of gathering information, including interviews.</p>

<p>I hope this was useful.</p>
