# What went well this year?

### I got my driving license

I never cared because I never needed a car. After playing Euro Truck Simulator for a while, I decided that someday I wanted to do such a big trip, and then I started with the academy. It was such a ride... having my exam canceled just some days before due to the COVID-19 explosion.

### I felt that my focus on the essentials was something I lived by

Examples like getting barely new clothes, focused on the ones that are cheap and neutral at the same time (I like to wear greay t-shirts). I also didn't get much unnecesary things.

### I spent a great time with Shei at Disneyland Paris

That was our only big trip for the year. We slept just a minutes away and visited both parks.

### I frew professionaly at my PM role

2020 was ‚Äúthe year‚Äù for Lang.ai. We got the biggest deals and completed a lot of milestones towards focusing the product for our customer and their real needs. I‚Äôm happy that we managed to keep it simple, being a challenge with different uses cases and such a technical core.

### Gave a talk online for Codemotion

I gave the talk ‚ÄúFrom developer to Product Manager‚Äù. It went way better than expected, with a lot of people attending and asking questions.

### Keeping my piano playing habit

It‚Äôs such a great habit to keep being creative and reduce stress. I really enjoy the time I spend playing.

### Keeping my healthy habits and doing excercises

That‚Äôs why I bought the Apple Watch. It‚Äôs all about the motivation and habits game.

### Journaling

A lot of entries during 2020 tracked in Notion.

### Got back to friends from far away

I spent a lot of time talking and playing with friends via Discord. It's a new habit that I really enjoy.

# What didn't go so well?

### I published half the episodes from the podcast

I didn't kept my habit of talking and learning from people as much as the last year. The year didn't start that bad, with a good episode recorded at Carto, but after the COVID arrived, I think I got unmotivated as it had a big impact on me. I felt lazier than usual.

### A global pandemic came in

This is a big deal. Thinking about it from an existencialest perspective, it's insane to think how one person eating a vat (?) can have such a barcaric impact on every corner of the world.

### I ready barely nothing

I just went throug a few books I can enumerate:

- Sci-fi
  - Hitchickers Guide to the Galaxy I and II
  - Sci-fi ‚Äî Do androings dream of electric sheep?
- Non-fiction
  - Never split the difference
  - Outcomes over output
  - Do nothing

I started a book about Epicuro and another one about the cynics but I didn't finish either.

### I had peaks of stress

I had a bad tim with some chest pain and I went to the doctor for a check. I stopped drinking coffee and go tthe habit of going for a walk every day, and to stop to play the piano a bit. This is also why I bought the Apple watch, in order to keep doing excercise to disconnect.

# What did I learn?

### I drastically improved my piano execution

Even thought I didn't improve the musical theory side, I jammed A lot and now I feel more agile. I also got used to some chords progressions and techniques on my own.

### I grew on my PM role, specially in team dynamics

Last year was the year of closing big deals and listening and participating with customers. We moved to a production-ready mode. I also learned a lot about observability and compliance, leading the SOC2 implementation in the company.

### I learned to drive

I moved from driving inside Euro Truck Simulator 2 to real roads. I feel confident with being cautious, knowing I still have few experience drawing.

# What's next?

## Personal

### Keep the progressive minimalism spirit

By buying less and letting go what‚Äôs not essential.

### Bring back philosophy into my reading habit

In the last few years I‚Äôve been reading a lot of philosophy and it had a remarkable impact in my life. Lately I replaced this with more work-related topics. I‚Äôm starting this year with Popper‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Open Society and its Enemies‚Äù.

### Keep my piano habit and take it to the next level

I would like to rotate jamming sessions and quick 20-minute lessons. I want to get the habit of piano learning along the years.

## Professional

### I am curious about the engineering manager role

I like that it connects tech with people in a deeper way than my current role, although the PM ingredientes of UX also resonate with me and it‚Äôs field I think I can be helpful.

### I am considering formal education for my PM role

Specially to strengthen the strategy and business side of this role.

### Improve my K8s knowledge

It might not be useful in another company, but while we don‚Äôt have another dedicated dev., I think it would be important to understand such a critical component from our infrastructure.

## Habits to break

- Don‚Äôt spend a while day playing with barely one exercise
- Don‚Äôt start the day without a clear, small, scheduled MIT (most important task)

## Habits to recover

- Meditation: start with 3 minutes every day after lunch
- Ready at home or at coffee shops
- Play ringgit at least once a week, along with the usual Badminton practice

# 2020 in Music

You can tell we went to an Editors concert. There is also a big influence from Rocket League artists. Lastly, the total scrobbles went up by 27%. 18.837 in 2020 vs 14.844 from 2019. One of the effects of working from home.

# A great 2021 would look like a place where

- I am healthy, with solid habits, and I manage my stress
- Professionally, where I learned more about product strategy and Lang became profitable. It‚Äôs true that this will change now that we have closed a funding round
- I can play more than just a few chords with barely no piano knowledge
- I read to know more about myself (philosophy) and for fun (sci-fi!)

For a great 2021!

See you in January 2022. üçø
