This is the second time I publish my annual review.

# 1. What went well this year?

* Being able to get close to the family and friends

This year I managed to travel to Argentina, where most of my family leaves, and to Asturias, where one of my brother lives since last year. The last time I visited Argentina was in 2012, travelling with the Mozilla community.

I spent time with all my family and travelled to Tigre with my older and smaller brothers. It is pretty exciting to see your grandmothers again after so many years.

* Moved to a Technical Product Manager role

I'ts been a year since I officialy stopped being a developer. I took the role because I always liked to be in the intersection of business, technology and design. It's not the first company where I actively helped the PM on various tasks and, thanks to it, I didn't have the same issues as someone taking the job as their first experience.

So far I'm enjoying it, but with greater responsability comes more stress. I struggled a little bit with that early on, but now I am managing better (which 90% of the times is reduced to saying "no").

* Learned how to use music production software

In October I completed the Ableton Live course from the Berkley \[TODO\]. I had so much fun with it. The possibilities are endless (which is a good and a bad thing). After publishing my first song in Halloween, I stopped with the habit of making music. I bought a book to keep learning, but right know I prioritized the habit of writing. Once I get it back as an habit, I want to go back to music. It's definitely something that relaxes me a lot and takes me to the zone easily.

* Stopped cheating on some habits

I've been cheating to myself for a while with the habits of language learning and meditation. I did spend a lot of valuable time with both habits, but once they becomed kind of boring, I started doing them without taking enough effort to make real progress. Now that I learned more about how habits work and how we react to the progress of them, I understand better what happend. The good side is that I stopped that behaviour and I'm aware of that issues, so I can prevent that from happening again.

* Dedicated more meaningful time to my partner

This one was one of my 2018 goals, and although is not easy to measure (because I am referring to meaningful time), I am sure that improved a lot.

* Had the badminton habit

* Moved to a new flat (better quality of life)

—> Divide into family, work, health, love, quality of life, honesty, productivity (better organization, alarm clock)

# 2. What didn’t go so well?

* Habits. Focusing on output instead of my personal identity. What I did with music. It happened the same as with the book. Also cant manage to get the journaling habit for more than 2 months.

* Side project

* Reading

* Finance (tracking)

# 3. What did I learn?

* Managing expectations and deadlines

* Leadership: communicate, involve, share, let other do their best work

* Focus on the essentials:

  * Work — you can’t do everything, Pareto principle

  * Life —As James said, when you don’t know what to focus on, focus on the essentials (love, health, learn)

* Protecting my time. Bulldoze calendar. Using freedom app. Working from home.
