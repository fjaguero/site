This is the second time I publish my annual review.

# 1. What went well this year?

- Being able to get close to the family and friends

This year I managed to travel to Argentina, where most of my family leaves, and to Asturias, where one of my brother lives since last year. The last time I visited Argentina was in 2012, travelling with the Mozilla community. 

I spent time with all my family and travelled to Tigre with my older and smaller brothers. It is pretty intense to see your grandmothers again after so many years.

- Moved to a TPM role (including first talk as a PM)

The



- Learned how to use music production software
- Stopped cheating on some habits
- Dedicated more meaningful time to my partner
- Had the badminton habit
- Moved to a new flat (better quality of life)

—> Divide into family, work, health, love, quality of life, honesty, productivity (better organization, alarm clock)

# 2. What didn’t go so well?

- Habits. Focusing on output instead of my personal identity. What I did with music. It happened the same as with the book. Also cant manage to get the journaling habit for more than 2 months.

- Side project
- Reading
- Finance (tracking)

# 3. What did I learn?

- Managing expectations and deadlines
- Leadership: communicate, involve, share, let other do their best work
- Focus on the essentials:
	- Work — you can’t do everything, Pareto principle
	- Life —As James said, when you don’t know what to focus on, focus on the essentials (love, health, learn)
- Protecting my time. Bulldoze calendar. Using freedom app. Working from home.

# 2018 in music

2019: start with the book club, reading habit, journaling app, habit tracking, habits book, writing habit again
