**It all began in a sunny afternoon in the beach**.

It was supposed to be a *quick footbal game* with my flatmate Ivo, but some Italians guys proposed to play a match. After 10 minutes, I was really tired. It began there, but let me give this some *context*.

When I was living in La Rioja (north Spain), I used to play football every weekend. We played for hours and hours, it was the routine. I remember that routine since I was 15, I guess. I left La Rioja in the beginning of 2012 and since then I didn’t practice much sport. The funny part is that I love playing football.

After that match in the beach I decided to start being what I used to be. It wasn’t hard to find a place to play football. Here in Valencia there is a place called Alameda (just at the side of the old river) and they are two or three football fields, among the improvised ones. I wanted to get in shape first, so I started thinking what to do next.


## A Quick Start

Running wasn’t something I liked, in fact, it looked boring as many people think. Without any information or even running shoes, I went to the river and then started running. With the help of the GPS, I tracked my speed and position, and it was really interesting to see how the rhythm was changing while running. The main inspiration was the people itself: it was full of people running. Young and old people. Some of the old ones duplicated my speed.

## The First Mistakes

I started running without thinking too much, like it was not rocket science at all. Obviously the first mistake was to star running without the proper equipment. I ran with my football shoes, and it was a big pain, but hey, I was running. I felt so motivated the first day that the next day I ran again. I thought 5k will be a good fresh start. I thought I can handle 5k, two days in a row. I was wrong. The second day I was completely destroyed... it was the first time I ran like that in probably 3 years. It was so hard to walk that I went to the office in a taxi (and it’s only 20 min walking).

It was like touching the ground from day zero. I’m happy that happened because now I understand what is overtraining and the need of going faster than your body can handle. After that day, the week later, I bought two books. The first one is called *Food and running* and the other is called *Running for Dummies: How to prepare a Marathon*. In two days of reading I learned a lot, specially the importance of being healthy by not doing too much excercise and eating properly. After all, we are what we eat.

## Training Begins

I stopped running for a week but I was mentally preparing for a fresh new start. I went to a Nike store to buy the running shoes but I didn’t: the girl from the store didn’t know too much about running. Yes, she almost sell me the Nike 3.0, which is a new model with almost no sole. I talked with more people and it was like I suspected: that shoes wasn’t recommended for begginers (at all). It was the new, trendy stuff, but before going to the shop I learnt that it’s crucial to find the propers shoes for you, whatever the brand or design.

I spoke with Alvaro, the CEO of my company, and he recommended me a place. It was not a big store, but it was a trusted place by many runners in Valencia. I went there and the experience was completely different. I spent almost 30 minutes talking with the guy from the store. He explained me all the technologies from every brand, and recommended me 6 different shoes that may be a good choice. I finally chose the Asics ones. It was “love at first try”. Since I never tried running shoes before, I was used to normal football shoes... but the feeling was something that I never felt before. I was thinking something like: “Ok, everyone can run with this!”. They were other options but I decided to take them home. The same day I started the training.

## A new feeling

Running can give you many different feelings. Some people may say that it’s only a way to feel pain and get exhausted, but others like me see in running a way to escape from the world that worry us. I started running with music, but then I stopped and realized that the disconnection with the world is even more when you feel the things happening around you. Running is a way to learn that, if you put effort on something, you can get it. The training is always a way to beat myself and show me that the effort is on the right track. Crossing the finish line in every training is really empowering. It feels like you completed your mission, your task at hand.

My first objective is the 10k. I hope I can get to this in June (or at least that’s what the training program says!).

PD: I finished my first 50k today!

See you on the road!
