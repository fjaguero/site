Taking design decisions is not an easy task, specially if you and your team don’t have a clear vision about the early adopters and target users. Here is where Personas come to help. **We will be discussing what they are, how to build them and why they are important**.

A Persona is an archetype of a typical user of your product: a fictional character with name and a full story around him.

You target users can be probably *translated* in at least 2 or 3 clear *Personas*. 

## Why they are important

## Building Personas
In order to build a Persona, you need to have a clear vision of what you are going to build. This includes a series of assumptions: [business goal, problem to solve, target, among others]. 

There is no step-by-step perfect guide to build a Persona since it may vary depending of what info you have and the level of detail you want for them. 

### Gather the required information

If you don’t have resources and you can’t afford gather information by interviewing people for a certain period of time, you should follow the Lean UX strategy. This way, you will be developing Personas using assumptions. As you may now, the Lean UX methodology strives for a quick and iterative approach to develop a product. This may be a little dangerous, specially if your team have the same background. For example, no one worked in the food industry and you are building a product related with food. The assumptions may not differ enough to consider another quick reality check.

In the other hand, if you already spent time interviewing potential users or early adopters, you will be using this information to develop each one.

### Use a template

As I already said, there’s no perfect way to develop personas, so I designed this template by taking what I liked from what I learned before and added what I thought it was missing or will be adding value.

Let's have a look at this [example Persona](http://https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Uca_Q67QPoui4-FhE0j_jNBby0rfpZWj_MG6Uy36pw/edit) for a clothing store. Feel free to leave suggestions and use it for your project.

The avatar is taken from a public repository of photos, [UI faces](http://http://uifaces.com/authorized). All this users have given their consent, so feel free to use them.

I like to dive a little bit in the personal story… at the end of the day your team should think of her as a user that exists and, probably, is willing to become a power user if all the design decisions taken makes him happier.

## [Conclusion]?

Developing Personas is a key point in the UX process. If you are building a product or even if you have already done it, consider taking the time to discuss this deliverable with your team. This will clarify all the doubts and will *force* the team to share a common vision and to understand why the product they are building is useful. You can actually imagen the Personas you already developed enjoying your product.

Feel free to ask any question or add a comment to improve the template.

In next posts I will be talking a bit more in the early process of gathering information, including interviews.

I hope this was useful.
