The war began 2 years ago against the Omnics. A cold winter in the city of Rambia was waiting for Zarim, a young soldier. It was his first time. The sweating of his face was a odd. The fight against humanity will start that same evening. The objective: the nuclear base of Florida. That base will allow omnics to generate an invincible army. Victory was written on that walls.

The night before he dreamed of the first struggles with the human police. He felt alone for a moment. Humans were fighting with them back in 2054. They wanted freedom and equal rights for everyone. Sadly, he remembered that days as the good ol' days.
