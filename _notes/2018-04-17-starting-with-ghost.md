A new adventure begins with **Ghost 0.3.2.**

As a Wordpress developer it's great to see new approaches and participate on how online publishing evolves.

I recently started using [Medium](http://medium.com/@fjaguero) for elaborated articles. The bad thing about this articles is that they consume time researching and validating information. That's the reason why I am starting here: the simplicity. The idea of this blog is to **share small thoughts or discoveries.** 

Don't forget that code is also poetry.
