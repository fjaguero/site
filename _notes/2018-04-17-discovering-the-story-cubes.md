Last month I discovered the [Story Cubes](https://www.storycubes.com/) while navigating on my Instagram feed. One of the users I follow, [@peregrinogris](https://www.instagram.com/peregrinogris/), started the #100dayproject using this _kids_ toy that boosts creativity.

They are basically packs of **themed dices** (mythic, animals, space, etc.) that you roll to create stories. It's recommended to mix dices from different sets to generate an interesting story. Another tip is to start by writing 100-words stories. Constraints are another way to boost creativity.

People say that _reading is a great way to improve your writing_. Since I'm happy with my recent read habit reinforcement (thanks to [1984](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5470.1984?ac=1&) and [Creativity Inc.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077903-creativity-inc?ac=1)), the next step is to start writing more _again_.

My plan is to start writing 100-word stories each day and post a weekly article with them. I already ordered [this pack](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B014VZFN0G/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on Amazon!

**Never settle.**
