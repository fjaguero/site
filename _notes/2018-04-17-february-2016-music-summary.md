title: 2018 04 17 February 2016 Music Summary
---

This month was HUGE. Probably one of the best of this year if we speak about music events. I saw two great bands live: **The Tallest Man On Earth** and **Millencolin**.

Below is a list of my most listened artists of the month and 5 songs picks. The order of the picks doesn't mean that I like one more that another.

## Top Listened Artists

#### 1. Millencolin

![Millencolin Live](/content/images/2016/02/millencolin2.jpg)

They are a living legend. The _skater_ culture group by definition. I even tweeted that legenday moment when the concert finished: the last song was _No Cigar_. You can check all the songs they played on Madrid on the [Setlist](http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/millencolin/2016/penelope-madrid-spain-3f34d7f.html) website.

#### 2. The Tallest Man on Earth

![Tallest](/content/images/2016/02/tallest.jpg)

The Tallest Man on Earth **is on my top 5 most listened artists** from the last 10 years. Seen live: checked.

![Top 5](/content/images/2016/02/Captura-de-pantalla-2016-03-01-a-las-0-45-11.png)

The concert was on the *Joy Eslava* club. First time there for me. The club looked like a small theater from the 60's. Small but cozy.

I was expecting a solo concert from *Kristian* but it turned out that he brought his entire _new_ band to the tour. He moved from the broken-voice-guitar to a more elaborated sound in his last album, _Dark Bird is Home_. Drums, bass, guitars, piano, violins and even a steel guitar. Incredible sound. The climax of the concert was expected: _King of Spain_.

Some of my picks (yes, 4 of the from the last album but you should listen to his old work too!):

* [Seventeen](https://open.spotify.com/track/1GJVeB5PXNt7MDdCzcSaX2)
* [Dark Bird Is Home](https://open.spotify.com/track/1nnbJ38IrwJQqV3qIOZYVR)
* [Sagres](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Gq0UPgMkDhyjj3zBkn9gU)
* [Darkness of the Dream](https://open.spotify.com/track/094cCpKByEKVze7f72wVX9)
* [King of Spain](https://open.spotify.com/track/3SXsoJxUF3C9XjZnGMZbXn)

#### 3. Gareth Coker

![Ori](/content/images/2016/02/ori.jpg)

There's always an OST.

Recently I witnessed one of the best soundtracks a video game can have. It's not the first time that Gareth works in the field of games, but his masterpiece is definitely **Ori and the Blind Forest.** Props to Aeralie Brighton for that voice.

If you want to really understand what I'm talking about, go [play the game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/261570/) an experience it.

My picks from the original soundtrack:

* [Ori, Lost In the Storm (feat. Aeralie Brighton)](https://open.spotify.com/track/1AvDDjLuwwC63X1xlRReCD)
* [Naru, Embracing the Light (feat. Rachel Mellis) ](https://open.spotify.com/track/3xi2OTo7NcuXeOAadk7Uy3)
* [Inspiriting](https://open.spotify.com/track/2zRITpQkUmaRwfIC2dsCIC)
* [Restoring the Light, Facing the Dark](https://open.spotify.com/track/06bhzoaKDYTkgMB6yzgRoy)
* [Light of Nibel (feat. Aeralie Brighton)](https://open.spotify.com/track/79aotvPXTlHbZ8MvoxhqAE)

#### 4. Angels and Airwaves
![Ava](/content/images/2016/03/ava.jpg)

This last week I traveled back to 2006. When blink-182 disappeared, +44 and AvA started with fresh but different sounds. The one that DeLonge presented started a revolution in the genre as it wasn't the typical punk-rock band. It felt like a rock band that came from the future.

My picks are from their first albums:

* [Everything's Magic](https://open.spotify.com/track/4eC8Cq2Q6zIelJgF4nC2DK)
* [Good Day](https://open.spotify.com/track/4I9XyDNevIrsMlCLDiZOuR)
* [Secret Crowds](https://open.spotify.com/track/5tz7UrfFRduRbQgrn91B6Y)
* [It Hurts](https://open.spotify.com/track/5TUAwxEDqA6f86jQjBOvNI)
* [True Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/6SzjXcc5UjmMP1Fzj15tYm)

#### 5. blink-182

![Blink182](/content/images/2016/03/blink2.jpg)
As I previously said, I traveled back to 2006 recently and that's why blink-182 is in the top 5 of the month.

There is little to say about this group... they still hold the record of being my most listened group of all time.

![Blink](/content/images/2016/02/Captura-de-pantalla-2016-03-01-a-las-0-50-12.png)
