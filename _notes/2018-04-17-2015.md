It's time for retrospective.

I didn't find my 2015 planning so I won't be able to do a comparison of what was expected and what happened but I'm still able to look back and check what happened.

**2015** was a year of **change**, mainly because I left Mindrop and moved to Madrid to join Séntisis. It was also a year of **learning** since I learned a lot professionally speaking. In personal terms I will highlight the foundation of ValenciaJS, running more official races and embracing the change of what I will call home.

Below is a list of happenings for my future self.

## 2016: The year of contributions

I want this year to be the one **for open source**.

Not only in a pull-request way, but also by creating stuff that empowers people. All of this will be developed in the open so anyone can learn or fork/improve what I have been working on.

I planned to launch *[Camino](https://github.com/fjaguero/camino)* in a maximum of 13 weeks. I'm using the [BestSeflCo roadmap](http://bestself.co/products/13-week-wall-calendar) to track the progress. The idea of Camino is more or less the same of the daily planner/goal tracker I'm using with pen and paper but with the benefits of an application: automation, statistics, data manipulation, etc. I'm building something I will be using everyday and I hope other people will find it useful.

![Planner](http://cl.ly/321z2s2B1a1V/13week.png)

I have set just a few goals so I can focus on them every day and every week. I already shared them on the [previous post](http://blog.fjaguero.com/sharing-my-life-goals-on-github/), posted them also on my github "life" [repo](https://github.com/fjaguero/life).

In terms of *checkpoints*, I will be using a week and 3-month retrospectives to review what I learned, which were the big wins and how well I am progressing towards my goals.

Right now I'm looking forward 2016 to be a year where I:

* Grow as a Javascript developer even more than 2015
* Get the at least the A1 certificate of german
* Manage my time in a better way to achieve all the planned goals 
* Read at least 12 books
* Write more, at least 3 posts each month
* Launch Camino

Have a nice year!

Never settle.
