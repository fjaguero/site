Today different countries come together **to promote and educate people about privacy on the Web**, and we think that is a pretty important issue.

The [protection of privacy](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/) has always been key for Firefox (and Mozilla) and we are active in the search for new ways to give Internet users more control over their personal information.

### What you can do
Here you have some ideas to ensure privacy on Firefox:

-  Turn on [Do Not Track](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-turn-do-not-track-feature)

- Use the [Lightbeam](https://www.mozilla.org/lightbeam) addon to discover who is following you

- Explore the thousands of [Firefox add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/extensions/privacy-security/) to enhance privacy and security

Happy Privacy Day!
