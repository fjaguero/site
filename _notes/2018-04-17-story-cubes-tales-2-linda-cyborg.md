Year 2350. The annual cyborg race championship was about to begin. As usual on that time, the smell of industrial chemicals wasn't nothing new to notice while flying among the skyscrapers. Linda checked both propellers from his chest and after a second of deep focus, the competition started.

Heather Mills, her main opponent to reach the victory, wanted to win at all costs. After the speed-loop tunnel descend she pushed Linda out of the track, making her to hit one of the buildings. Linda was falling all over the city with the astonishment of the people that were enjoying the competition.

Luckly, a huge land-transport vehicle was driving along the ground. Linda, unconscious, collided with it. The medical services arrived. Linda were being transported to a medical facility when the operators started to notice something unusual in her human vitals metrics. Gary, from the human-med team joked about it and another conversation carried on. That day she changed forever. That truck saved her life. It won't be her last championship.
