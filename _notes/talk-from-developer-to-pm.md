Two weeks ago I gave a talk at Codemotion Webinars about my transition from development to product management. The talk description is as follows: "I have been working as a front-end developer for ten years. In 2018 I changed my role after spending a few years working closely with product managers. It was something I liked and was already exploring back then. In these slides I share the main three problems I struggled with during the transition."

It was really fun as a lot of people (more than expected!) joined the webinar and shared really interesting questions after the presentation.
