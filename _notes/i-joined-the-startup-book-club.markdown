Starting January 1st, I am following a [book club](https://discourse.thestartupbook.club/) that I learned about [on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/the-startup-book-club). The objective is to read one book every two weeks and discuss them in the forum. The first book is called ["Atomic Habits"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) and I'm almost finishing it... and I'm loving it!
