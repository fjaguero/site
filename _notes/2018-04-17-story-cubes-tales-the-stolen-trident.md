![Story 1 dices](/content/images/2016/06/story1.jpg)

Zeus, the greatest of all the gods, was deeply angry with the humanity. Semi-gods seldom were the cause of trouble. That day Aurelius stole the magnificent trident from his brother, Poseidon, while he was sleeping. Shortly after, Hermes discovered that Aurelius knew he were being persecuted and decided to hide in the Hydra maze.

Aurelius was the most ambitious human on earth. He always wanted to be a semi-god and and be worshiped by the people from his village. He knew he will probably die after the gods were chasing him, but he wasn't afraid to death: he wanted glory.
