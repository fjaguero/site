**It's been a huge year at Mozilla**. And the previous one... and the past one.

Many people asked me *how is to be a volunteer* at Mozilla-Hispano. I always tell the same stories about **working with awesome people** and meeting even more other incredible persons. Sometimes I feel that I know people that are able to
contribute in many ways, but they are missing it. Saving the world and changing the Web for the better is something that is not easy to describe.

**Life at Mozilla** will be a series of posts about **what I have done and how we work**. This is an attempt to get the people to know the community and to invite everyone to join us on the adventure.

I hope you'd like them!
