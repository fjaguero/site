Last month I [interviewed Jorge Ferreiro](https://inprogressshow.com/10-shipping-side-projects-with-jorge-ferreiro) about shipping side projects. This is now the tenth episode for the podcast, published one year and two months after the first one, back in May 2019.

I have been learning a lot from product and B2B marketing to QA practices. It’s been a great journey, and I’m looking forward to keep meeting more experts from the industry.
