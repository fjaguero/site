While writing my 2015 recap post I stumbled with a [post](http://www.bonillaware.com/objetivos-para-2016) from [David Bonilla](https://twitter.com/david_bonilla) through twitter, it was another *resolutions* post. After reading the article I moved to the comments and discovered that [Elena TorrÃ³](https://twitter.com/elenarcolepsia) was using an idea she found on GitHub: **a repo to create your goals as issues**, getting the closed issues as achievements.

This experiment was started by [Feross Aboukhadijeh](https://github.com/feross/Life) back in 2013 and it's basically another way to map your short/medium/long term goals. The main difference is that this is public by default (you still can have your repo private), and it's a nice way to get all your achievements tracked in a place you usually visit.

These are my *issues* right now:

I also wanted to create a to-do list when possible as it makes easier to track and complete the goals by making small and constant progress. This is my *work-in-progress* reading list:

### How am I going to achieve all of this?

I am fan of tracking things (no, I don't have a fitness tracker band) and to make stuff happen, so what I'm doing right now is **writing a daily note every morning** with the top 3 priorities, the daily timeline, what I am grateful for, etc. There's also a night routine where I write the wins, lessons learned and the night gratitude. The key here is that this note has a *goals* section where I have every single goal reminding me to take action.

The yesterday's note looked like this:

These goals change over time and it's a selection of what has a higher priority or are kind of *quick-wins*.

The workflow is heavily borrowed from the [SELF Journal](http://bestself.co/products/self-journal), something I just bought this week as it's a project I'd like to support.

I share what they think of getting stuff done:
> The secret to success is in the small actions you take every day.

By taking little steps and staying focused you can achieve whatever you want, you just need to **create some habits**.

Never settle.
