If you are planning **on getting a whiteboard** for your office, make sure to get it **as bigger as you can**. **Whiteboards saves lives**, and *startups*. I think we used both side of the whiteboard every single day singe we bought it. Tons of photographs converted on wireframes, technical requirements, a user journey and tweaks on a prototype.

After a **month an half** of validating our idea, market and users, **we started designing** what we wanted to build. Let the wireframes begin.


### Fast prototyping

I started prototyping with HTML/CSS and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/). We wanted to have the final design quick (on 48 hours) so I moved to Photoshop and, with the magical help of [Invision](http://www.invisionapp.com/), I designed the remaining interactions. The party of iterations was there.

### Quick iteration

We commented every single screen. Some new screens were added and other were drastically changed. It is not a surprise that after designing the user journey you discover new hidden corners of the app. Maybe a field you forgot or a link to the legal terms.

### Designing validations

The main reason on working on an *alpha* demo of your product is only one: To **know more about your users**. How can you achieve this? Test. Validate. Repeat.

We are using [Mixpanel](www.mixpanel.com), [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) and database queries. I counted more than 50 metrics to get on a simple 3 main screens demo. Now is the time to learn and break thinks while programming. You will need this later on the *MVP*.

We have individual stats for each session of a user. In this case, the sessions are periods of activity until the users stops using it for 4 hours. The product is something you can use 20 minutes, do other work, and then come back... but that is not another real session for the user. We want to know what happens when the user comes back and re-uses the app.

### Next steps

Ruby on Rails for back-end, Backbone.js+Sass for front-end and some Elasticsearch sugar for the database. These are the main ingredients to make this happen.

Now the best part comes: Making things happen.

See you on the kitchen!
