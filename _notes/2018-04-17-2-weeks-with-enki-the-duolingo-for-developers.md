I have been using [Enki](https://www.enki.com/) for more than two weeks now and although it has some bugs (which is why they are invite-only right now), **it's been great so far**.

The first thing you need to do is choose **the topics** you want to learn. Right now they are 4 topics to choose: **Linux, JavaScript, CSS and Java**. Each topic have 3 different difficulty levels that will modify what kind of lesson you will receive. They are also **games**.

After picking the topics and the difficulty you will prompt to pick what do you want to start learning:

Each lesson consist of 5 explanations/tips with code included. You can keep track of all the lessons and even share or star them.

The example below is part of the **Browser APIs** lesson:

Games are also part of Enki. Almost every time you finish a lesson a new game becomes available. They include different mechanics: swipe left or right, fill in the gap, etc.

An example of the **Ecmascript Time Travel** game:

Spending just 5 minutes everyday is enough to learn interesting tips from multiple topics. It's definitely a good habit to acquire.

**I recommend it: it's useful and fun at the same time.**

Never settle.
