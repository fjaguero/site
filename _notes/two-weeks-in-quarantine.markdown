It's been two weeks and one day since we don't go outside. It's been hard, especially with the good weather
from the last days. On the bright side, this quarantine helped me reflect on how I am spending my time. I have been
working on reducing the distractions from the communication tools such as Slack or e-mail. I moved back to the moment
where I literally removed both applications from my phone. It's refreshing.

I wonder how we will feel the first time we go out again. In these two weeks, I only interacted with a person in the stairs
when I was going to take the trash (inside the building) and another time when the groceries arrived. There was no contact with this person, as he left the bags and entered the elevator.
