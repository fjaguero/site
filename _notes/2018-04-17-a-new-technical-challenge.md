**It must be a coincidence, but this is today's [Sketchplanation](http://www.sketchplanations.com/post/68011185901/match-challenge-with-skills-for-flow-at-work-i).**

I joined [Aluana Labs](http://www.aluana.com) last month and since then we have been working really hard on the *lean canvas* and on the product design.

We're still on the validation phase, but **after more than 30 interviews** with potentiall early adopters, we discovered many features that we had not even thought.

Now we need to choose what to do next, and **what to ship first**. There is where the first challenge comes.

I always quote this when talking about features:

See you!
