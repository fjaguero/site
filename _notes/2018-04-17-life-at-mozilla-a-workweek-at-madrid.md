This is a series of what is like to be a Mozillian. [Join us](http://mozilla-hispano.org/participa) or ping me [on twitter](http://twitter.com/fjaguero) if you want to ask something.

## Going forward, faster

This April we had a community meeting on Madrid to kickoff the year. People from both America an Spain joined to set the objectives on which we will be working later on this year. It was a pity that I only assisted for only one entire day of work, but still worth it. Some projects are horizontal, so **talking with the right people of each area is blazing fast to advance**.

The last day, Gabriela Montagu guided a special test day focusing on the Sync functionalities (thanks Juan Becerra for the effort). I also want to highlight the talk by Jorge Villalobos about how the Labs blog is performing and what are the next steps. 

### An optimized Workweek

We already had the same experiencie last year in [Peru](/life-at-mozilla-a-workweek-at-peru/), and we learned a lot from that one. This year we applied all the learnings and, in my opinion, had a more productive workweek. This time all the presentations were really quick and in an introductive form, **focusing on what are the next steps and how we can solve our current problems** instead of discussing what we have done and which problemas we had.

### The aftermath

After the Workweek, we counted **133 new issues** in our intranet. That is a lot of work to do!

Taking part of the Mozilla community is, as I always said, more than great, so whatever is the task in hand, working with these awesome team of people is motivating and a way of continuous learning.
