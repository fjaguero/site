I've been using **Dash** for years now. It's a simple tool that allows me to code in a more efficient way since it helps me get to the documentation in just a second. They define themselves as _an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager_.

It supports _namespaces_ so you can do something like `react:` to search only on the React documentation although it works perfectly without the need of using them. It also offers offline documentation (which is their main feature that I only used once).

This is how my _Dash_ looks:

#### The key is the shortcut
The game changing thing is to use the right **shortcut**. Thanks to it I can quickly open Dash, search and close it again. In my case I'm using `CMD+SHIFT+E`.

I use this a lot, from small details of the _underscore_ library to bigger implementations docs from _D3_.

It also has a **Snippets**  functionality, which is really cool. I used it in the past but right now I moved all of my code snippets directly to Atom (like a React component boilterplate we use at SÃ©ntisis). 

#### Using non-code snippets
The fun thing here is that I'm using it to answer some recruiters on Linkedin. They also use a template so... why not? You can even use a `placeholder`. That being said, I usually answer to everyone and in some cases (specially when I see that they actually took the time to get some info or read my blog) write a proper answer.

Never settle.
