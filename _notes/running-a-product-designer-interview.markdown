Today I ran another interview. This time it was for the Product Designer role. It was the last step of the process, and it was quite funny.

The interviewee presented a project that she selected and then went through the decision-making process. Then, we did a group exercise starting from the documentation of a real product **Epic**, including business background, stories and interactions. As a group we brainstormed and asked questions.

It was a win-win. It was both funny and productive.
