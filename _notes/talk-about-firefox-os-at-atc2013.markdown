Today I gave a talk in Valencia, at the *App Trade Centre*. I talked about Firefox OS, what it is, and why we think that the Web is the platform.

We had real fun with some jokes and people loved the Inception's "A browser inside a browser?" meme and the "Apple way" of introducing free software on a keynote.

The talk included several demos:

* WebRTC: Talky.io and webrtc.org demo
* Asm.js and Goo Engine: Epic Citadel and Pearl Boy
* Installing a webapp as native on MacOS

Thanks to everyone who attended!
