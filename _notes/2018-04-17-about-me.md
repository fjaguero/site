**Thanks for passing by. It's great to see new faces.**

My name is **Fernando Agüero** and I am on my way to achieve my [goals](https://github.com/fjaguero/life/issues).

I have been working in the Web industry for 10 years now and decided to start writing a book: [The Success Hacker](http://thesuccesshacker.es/). It's basically a practical guide on productivity, building efficient teams and overcoming complexities.

A passionate Web developer focused on _JavaScript_ stacks and heavily involved in tech communities. I am currently working as a Front-End developer at [Séntisis](http://sentisis.com).

I founded [ValenciaJS](https://medium.com/the-web-is-the-platform/introducing-valenciajs-1a73d39a9c94#.nfwz6gpsi) in 2015 as an effort to empower the JS community in Valencia, the third biggest city of Spain. I’ve been involved in the Mozilla Hispano community for almost 4 years now, helping to promote openness, innovation & opportunity on the Web. I gave talks in Argentina, Spain, Peru and Poland related to Mozilla.

As a personal challenge, I started to learn German in 2015. Right now I'm also doing a creative exercise with the [story cubes](http://fjaguero.com/tag/story-cubes/).

Music and video games are also key in my daily life since my dad is a guitarist so I started playing it when I was young. On the other hand, while I was making my firsts websites with 10 years, I started playing video games. The last year I've been supporting the e-sports community and gaming really taught me a lot.
